SQL Converter using Google's Generative AI Gemini Model
This project aims to leverage the power of Google's Generative AI Gemini Model to create a tool that can convert SQL queries between different dialects and database management systems. The SQL Converter streamlines the process of migrating databases or working with multiple database systems by automating the translation of SQL statements.
Features

SQL Dialect Conversion: The tool can convert SQL queries from one dialect to another, such as converting between MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and others.
Database Management System Translation: In addition to dialect conversion, the SQL Converter can translate SQL queries to be compatible with different database management systems (DBMS), allowing seamless migration between systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
Query Optimization: The tool utilizes the Gemini Model's natural language processing capabilities to analyze and optimize SQL queries, ensuring efficient execution and performance improvements.
Error Handling: The converter can detect and handle common SQL syntax errors, providing relevant feedback and suggestions for correcting the queries.
